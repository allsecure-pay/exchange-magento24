provide dictionary files - see `i18n` directory.

For more details on how Magento handles translations, refer to Magento's
documentation
([see "Translations overview"](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/frontend-dev-guide/translations/xlate.html)
and
["Use translation dictionary to customize strings"](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/frontend-dev-guide/translations/theme_dictionary.html)).

> Note: the plugin makes no guarantees for about backwards compatibility of
> translation keys for future releases.
